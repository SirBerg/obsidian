You can declare something is so and so using だ:
## Example:
```
人だ
Translation:
Is person

Kanji used:
人 = ひと, meaning Person or Human
```

## Explanation
There is no equivalent to "to be" in Japanese, instead だ is being used. This can only be attached to a **noun** or a **na**-adjective.

---
## Important
A state-of-being can be implied without using `だ`. So only saying `人` would also work.

### Example conversation:
<sub>Note: this is a very casual conversation, when talking in a more serious environment use more elaborate words or だ</sub>
```
A: 元気? (Note: Japanese doesn't need a question mark)
A: (Are you) well?

B: 元気.
B: (I'm) well

Kanji used:
元気 = げんき, meaning healthy, well, fit, etc.
```
