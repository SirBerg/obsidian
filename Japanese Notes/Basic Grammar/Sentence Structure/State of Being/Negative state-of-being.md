To conjugate to the negative state-of-being, just add `じゃない` to the end:
## Example:
```
学生じゃない
Translation:
Is not Student

Kanji used:
学生 = がくせい, meaning Student
```

## Explanation
In Japanese, negative and past tense are all expressed by conjugation. Every noun and adjective can be conjugated to either declare that something _is not [X]_ or that something _was [X]_  **but** none of these are making something declarative like using `だ` as in [[State of Being]]
