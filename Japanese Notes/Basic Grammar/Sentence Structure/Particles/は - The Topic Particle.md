The [[Particle Summary |Particle]]　は is usually used to identify **what** is being talked about in a Sentence. As with every other particle *it cannot be translated and has no meaning in English and German*. 
> [!warn] Difficulties with the は particle
> This letter is usually pronounced as *ha*, but if it is used as a particle it's pronounced as ***wa***. This can throw people of when first reading sentences, so keep this in mind.
## Situations in which to use this Particle
You can find this particle in almost every Sentence you're going to build. An example would be this:
```text
ボブ:アリスは学生?
Bob: Is Alice (you) student?

アリス:うん、学生。
Alice: Yeah, (I) am.

Used words:
学生 = gakusei = Student
うん = un = yeah
アリス = Arisu = Alice (Name)
ボブ = Bob = Bob (Name)
```
Here,  the は particle indicates that Bob is talking about Alice. You could also write the rule like this:

> The word *before* the は particle is the subject of the sentence.

Another example:

```text
あなたは外国人ですか?
Is this a foreigner?

Used words:
あなた = anata = you (!Note: this is regarded as a rude form nowadays, https://jisho.org/word/%E8%B2%B4%E6%96%B9-1)
外国人 = gakokujin = foreigner, foreign citizen
```
Here, the speaker is talking about *you* and is asking if you're a foreigner or a foreign citizen.
