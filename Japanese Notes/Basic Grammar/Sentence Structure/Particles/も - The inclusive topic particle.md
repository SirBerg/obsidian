____
The も Particle, although very similar in use to the [[は - The Topic Particle |は Particle]], is the inclusive topic particle. This particle essentially means "also". Basically it introduces another topic into the sentence.
## Situations in which to use this Particle
Keep in mind that this particle can both mean "also" and "but" depending on the context of the sentence.
```text
ボブ:アリスは学生?
Bob: Is Alice (you) student?

アリス:うん、トムも学生。
Alice: Yeah, and Tom is also student.
```

> [!NOTE] Inclusion of this particle
> The inclusion of the も particle must be consistent with the answer of the sentence. It wouldn't make sense to say, "I am a student, and Tom is also **not** a student". Refer to the next example to see how you would do that.

This example shows how you would say that *you* are a student, but *Tom* isn't.
```text
ボブ:アリスは学生?
Bob: Is Alice (you) student?

アリス:うん、でもトムはも学生じゃねい。
Alice: Yeah, but Tom is not student
```
If you want to have both negative, you can use the particle like this:
```text
ボブ:アリスは学生?
Bob: Is Alice (you) student?

アリス:ううん、トムも学生じゃねい。
Alice: No, and Tom is also not student.
```

All in all, this is a pretty easy particle compared to most other in the language. Just make sure that you keep the answer consistent with the rest of the sentence and you should be fine
